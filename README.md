# Embedded Systems

## Specification
Embedded systems course at Imperial College London looking into the development and operation of small scale systems.

## Coursework 1

Coursework one was to design and develop an IoT product concept using the Adafruit Huzzah board and an external sensor. This sensor would interact with the world and, using the ESP8266 core of the Huzzah breakout board, send data over the WiFi network to a server where the data could be processed and used to perform some useful function.

One of the members of our team is an avid ice hockey player and has experienced occasions where he has suffered a head trauma as a result of the sport which has led to him suffering from what is known as a micro-concussion. In order to help identify when these occur, our product will be worn by the players and monitor their condition. Using a MPU 6050 accelerometer and gyroscope, it sends data in real-time to a server which uses machine learning to detect when an impact may have occured and flag this up on a webpage. This allows the coach or other support personnel to easily identify the impact and take the relevant precautions to ensure the well-being of their team.
